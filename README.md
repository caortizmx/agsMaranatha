## Public Font Library Recommendation

To complement the refreshed header design, consider using **Google Fonts**, a free and widely trusted font library. It offers an extensive catalog of open-licensed typefaces, easy CDN integration, and performance-focused loading options (such as `display=swap`). Visit [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com) to browse families, generate `<link>` tags, or download font files for self-hosting.
